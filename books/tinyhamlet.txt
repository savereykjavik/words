Enter to him BERNARDO BERNARDO Who's there? FRANCISCO Nay, answer me stand, and unfold yourself. BERNARDO Long l now struck twe ll-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and, at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, HAMLET - Act I 10The extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine and of the truth herein This present object made probation. MARCELLUS It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad; The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.

So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting Thus much the business is we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,-- Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears Of
