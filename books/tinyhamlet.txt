Enter to him BERNARDO BERNARDO Who's there? FRANCISCO Nay, answer me stand, and unfold yourself. BERNARDO Long l now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

FRANCISCO Nay, answer me stand, and unfold yourself. BERNARDO Long l now struck twe ll-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and, at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, HAMLET - Act I 10The extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine and of the truth herein This present object made probation.
